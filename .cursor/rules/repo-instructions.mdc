## Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing with explicit interfaces and return types
- **Imports**: Group imports (React, third-party, local), use named imports
- **Components**: Functional components with props destructuring
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components/interfaces, camelCase for variables/functions
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with kebab-case class names
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks, graceful fallbacks, console warnings
- **Tests**: Vitest with JSDOM, detailed mocks, place in `__tests__` folders
